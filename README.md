🌟 Smart Study Planner

A modern, fully open-source web application designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners organize tasks, enhance productivity, and track performance efficiently. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, and LocalStorage, this project demonstrates advanced UI/UX design, gamification, analytics, voice input, and offline-ready deployment. No backend or paid APIs are required.

📘 Overview

The Smart Study Planner is built to address common productivity challenges by integrating multiple productivity tools into a single, cohesive platform:

Task Manager (CRUD) – manage tasks efficiently with full create, read, update, delete functionality.

Pomodoro Timer – time-boxed work sessions with customizable work and break durations.

Analytics Dashboard – visualize task progress and time allocation per category.

Gamification – streaks and badges to encourage consistent productivity.

Voice Input – hands-free task creation via Web Speech API.

Theme Toggle – switch between Light and Dark modes with smooth transitions.

All data is persisted locally using LocalStorage, allowing instant deployment in any modern browser. The UI incorporates glassmorphism, smooth animations, responsive layouts, and micro-interactions for a professional and engaging user experience.
