🌟 Smart Study Planner

A modern, fully open-source web application designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners organize tasks, optimize productivity, and track progress efficiently. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, and LocalStorage, this project demonstrates advanced UI/UX design, gamification, analytics, voice input, and fully offline-ready deployment, with no backend or paid APIs required.

📘 Overview

The Smart Study Planner was created to address the common challenge of task management and productivity tracking in a single, cohesive platform. The application integrates:

A robust task manager with full CRUD functionality

Pomodoro Timer for structured, time-boxed productivity sessions

Analytics Dashboard with charts and dynamic progress indicators

Gamification features, including streak tracking and badges

Voice input for hands-free task creation

Light/Dark theme toggle with smooth animated transitions

All data is stored locally via LocalStorage, enabling users to deploy the application instantly by opening index.html in any modern browser. The platform’s futuristic UI/UX combines glassmorphism, responsive layouts, micro-interactions, and animations to provide a visually engaging and professional user experience.

This project serves as a demonstration of full front-end web development skills, accessible design, and open-source-first deployment principles.
