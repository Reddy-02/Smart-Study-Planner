🌟 Smart Study Planner

A modern, fully open-source web application to organize tasks, boost productivity, and track performance. Developed as a browser-based planner using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, and LocalStorage, this project demonstrates advanced UI/UX design, gamification, analytics, voice input, and offline-ready deployment without any backend or paid APIs.

📘 Overview

The Smart Study Planner is designed to help students, professionals, and lifelong learners manage their tasks efficiently while staying motivated. It combines a robust task manager, Pomodoro timer, analytics dashboard, and gamification features into a single futuristic web application.
All data is stored locally using LocalStorage, allowing instant deployment and offline functionality. The planner also supports voice input, theme toggle, and advanced UI interactions for a seamless experience across devices.
